[[Gary Brecka]]'s 30-30-30 method is a morning routine for health optimization:

1. Consume **30 grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking** to stabilize blood sugar and reduce cravings.
2. Perform 30 minutes of low-intensity, steady-state cardio (heart rate below 135 bpm, e.g., walking) to promote fat burning. 

The sequence is protein first, then cardio, designed to kickstart metabolism and enhance energy.
