[[Viscose]] is a type of rayon, a semi-synthetic fiber made from regenerated cellulose, typically derived from wood pulp or bamboo. It’s produced through a chemical process that dissolves cellulose in a solution, then extrudes it into fine threads. Viscose is soft, breathable, and drapes well, making it popular for clothing like dresses, shirts, and linings. It’s often used as a cheaper alternative to silk due to its smooth, lustrous feel. However, it’s less durable when wet and can shrink or wrinkle easily. Environmentally, its production can be resource-intensive and involve harmful chemicals, though sustainable versions exist.

# Certifications

Several certifications ensure eco-friendly viscose production with minimal or no harmful chemicals, focusing on sustainable sourcing, closed-loop systems, and strict chemical management. Here are the key certifications relevant to viscose production without harmful chemicals:

1. FSC (Forest Stewardship Council): Ensures wood pulp for viscose comes from responsibly managed forests, reducing deforestation. It doesn’t directly address chemicals but supports sustainable sourcing, a critical step for eco-friendly viscose.    
2. PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification): Similar to FSC, it certifies sustainable forest management for wood pulp used in viscose, ensuring responsible sourcing to minimize environmental harm.    
3. LENZING™ ECOVERO™: A specific certification for eco-friendly viscose, using closed-loop systems to recover and reuse chemicals like carbon disulfide, reducing emissions and water use by up to 50%. It also ensures sustainably sourced wood pulp.    
4. OEKO-TEX® Standard 100: Certifies that textiles, including viscose, are free from harmful substances. It tests for over 100 harmful chemicals, ensuring safety for consumers and reducing environmental impact from chemical residues.
5. OEKO-TEX® ECO PASSPORT: Verifies that chemicals, dyes, and auxiliaries used in textile production, including viscose, are free from harmful substances and comply with environmental standards, ensuring safer production processes.
6. Bluesign® System: Enforces strict chemical management, eliminating hazardous substances like carbon disulfide in viscose production. It promotes eco-friendly dyeing and resource-efficient processes to minimize environmental and worker health risks.
7. Cradle to Cradle Certified: Evaluates viscose across material health, recyclability, renewable energy, water stewardship, and social fairness. It ensures chemicals used are safe and processes are sustainable, supporting closed-loop systems.    
8. GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard): While primarily for organic fibers, GOTS can apply to viscose if sourced from certified organic cellulose. It restricts toxic chemicals and ensures environmentally friendly processing, including wastewater treatment.
These certifications prioritize closed-loop systems (e.g., ECOVERO™, Bluesign®) that recycle chemicals and water, significantly reducing the environmental and health impacts of toxic substances like carbon disulfide and sodium hydroxide. Look for brands using these certifications, such as Lenzing, Stella McCartney, or TWOTHIRDS, to ensure eco-friendly viscose. Always verify brand transparency, as greenwashing can occur without these certifications.

To rank the certifications for their effectiveness in eliminating toxin risk to consumers and their frequency of use in viscose production, I’ll evaluate each based on two criteria: toxin elimination (how strictly they regulate harmful chemicals to ensure consumer safety) and frequency of use (how commonly they’re applied to viscose specifically). The evaluation draws on their focus, scope, and industry adoption for viscose. Here’s the ranking, from most to least useful and commonly used, with explanations:

1. OEKO-TEX® Standard 100
    - Toxin Elimination (9/10): This certification rigorously tests textiles, including viscose, for over 100 harmful substances (e.g., carbon disulfide residues, heavy metals, azo dyes) to ensure they’re safe for consumer use. It directly addresses consumer safety by setting strict limits on chemical residues in the final product.
    - Frequency of Use (9/10): Widely adopted across the textile industry, including for viscose, due to its accessibility and global recognition. Many brands (e.g., H&M, Zara) use it for viscose garments to assure consumers of safety.
    - Why Ranked #1: Its comprehensive testing for consumer-facing products and widespread use in viscose textiles make it the most effective and common for eliminating toxin risk.
2. LENZING™ ECOVERO™
    - Toxin Elimination (8/10): Focuses on eco-friendly viscose production with closed-loop systems that recover up to 99% of chemicals like carbon disulfide, reducing residues in the final product. While not as exhaustive as OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 for consumer testing, its process minimizes harmful chemical outputs.
    - Frequency of Use (7/10): Increasingly common, especially among sustainable brands (e.g., Reformation, Stella McCartney), but limited to Lenzing’s viscose supply chain, which is significant but not as universal as OEKO-TEX®.
    - Why Ranked #2: Strong chemical management in production benefits consumers indirectly, and its growing adoption in sustainable viscose makes it highly relevant.
3. Bluesign® System
    - Toxin Elimination (8/10): Strictly regulates chemical inputs in textile production, banning hazardous substances (e.g., carbon disulfide, sodium hydroxide) and ensuring safer outputs. It focuses on the production process, which reduces toxin risks for consumers, though it’s less focused on final product testing than OEKO-TEX®.
    - Frequency of Use (6/10): Less common than OEKO-TEX® or ECOVERO™ for viscose, as it’s more prevalent in technical textiles (e.g., outdoor gear) but still used by eco-conscious brands like Patagonia for viscose blends.
    - Why Ranked #3: Excellent for chemical safety but less frequently applied to viscose compared to the top two due to its broader textile focus.
4. OEKO-TEX® ECO PASSPORT
    - Toxin Elimination (7/10): Certifies that chemicals used in textile production (dyes, auxiliaries) are free from harmful substances, reducing toxin risks in viscose processing. It’s more process-focused than product-focused, so consumer safety benefits are indirect compared to Standard 100.
    - Frequency of Use (5/10): Less common for viscose specifically, as it targets chemical suppliers rather than finished textiles. Used by some viscose manufacturers but not as widespread as Standard 100 or ECOVERO™.
    - Why Ranked #4: Effective for chemical safety but less directly tied to consumer products and less common in viscose.
5. GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard)
    - Toxin Elimination (7/10): Restricts toxic chemicals in processing and ensures wastewater treatment, reducing toxin risks in viscose if certified organic cellulose is used. Its focus on organic fibers limits its scope for conventional viscose, but it still ensures consumer safety through strict chemical rules.
    - Frequency of Use (4/10): Rarely applied to viscose, as it’s primarily for organic fibers like cotton. Some niche brands use GOTS-certified viscose, but it’s uncommon due to limited organic cellulose sources.
    - Why Ranked #5: Strong chemical restrictions, but its low adoption for viscose reduces its overall impact.
6. Cradle to Cradle Certified
    - Toxin Elimination (6/10): Assesses material health, ensuring chemicals are safe for humans and the environment. It reduces toxin risks in viscose but is less specific than OEKO-TEX® or Bluesign® for chemical testing, focusing on broader sustainability metrics.
    - Frequency of Use (3/10): Rarely used for viscose due to its holistic approach and high certification costs. Some sustainable brands may use it, but it’s not a standard for viscose.
    - Why Ranked #6: Good for toxin elimination, but its rarity in viscose production lowers its ranking.
7. FSC (Forest Stewardship Council)
    - Toxin Elimination (3/10): Focuses on sustainable forestry for wood pulp, not chemical use in viscose production. It indirectly supports safer viscose by ensuring eco-friendly sourcing but doesn’t address consumer toxin risks directly.
    - Frequency of Use (6/10): Common for viscose, as many producers (e.g., Lenzing) use FSC-certified pulp, but it’s not a direct indicator of chemical safety.
    - Why Ranked #7: High adoption but minimal focus on toxins makes it less relevant for consumer safety.
8. PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification)
    - Toxin Elimination (3/10): Like FSC, it ensures sustainable wood pulp sourcing but doesn’t regulate chemicals in viscose processing, offering little direct consumer safety benefit.
    - Frequency of Use (5/10): Used for viscose but less common than FSC, as it’s an alternative forestry standard with similar scope.
    - Why Ranked #8: Common enough but irrelevant for toxin elimination, placing it last.
