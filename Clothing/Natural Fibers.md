# Cotton

Soft, breathable, and biodegradable, derived from the cotton plant

# Wool

Sourced from sheep or other animals, warm, and naturally moisture-wicking. Has anti-microbial properties.

# Linen

Made from flax, durable, and highly breathable.

# Silk

Produced by silkworms, lightweight, and luxurious.

# Hemp

Strong, eco-friendly, and derived from the hemp plant.

# Tencel/Lyocell

https://www.tencel.com/en/fibers

Made from wood pulp, biodegradable, and produced in a closed-loop process.

# Bamboo

When processed without synthetic additives, it’s a natural, sustainable fiber.

# Jute

Coarse, biodegradable, and often used for sacks or rugs.

# Viscose

[[Viscose]] is a type of rayon, a semi-synthetic fiber made from regenerated cellulose, typically derived from wood pulp or bamboo. It’s produced through a chemical process that dissolves cellulose in a solution, then extrudes it into fine threads. Viscose is soft, breathable, and drapes well, making it popular for clothing like dresses, shirts, and linings. It’s often used as a cheaper alternative to silk due to its smooth, lustrous feel. However, it’s less durable when wet and can shrink or wrinkle easily. Environmentally, its production can be resource-intensive and involve harmful chemicals, though sustainable versions exist.

Several certifications ensure eco-friendly viscose production with minimal or no harmful chemicals, focusing on sustainable sourcing, closed-loop systems, and strict chemical management. Here are the key certifications relevant to viscose production without harmful chemicals:

1. FSC (Forest Stewardship Council): Ensures wood pulp for viscose comes from responsibly managed forests, reducing deforestation. It doesn’t directly address chemicals but supports sustainable sourcing, a critical step for eco-friendly viscose.    
2. PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification): Similar to FSC, it certifies sustainable forest management for wood pulp used in viscose, ensuring responsible sourcing to minimize environmental harm.    
3. LENZING™ ECOVERO™: A specific certification for eco-friendly viscose, using closed-loop systems to recover and reuse chemicals like carbon disulfide, reducing emissions and water use by up to 50%. It also ensures sustainably sourced wood pulp.    
4. OEKO-TEX® Standard 100: Certifies that textiles, including viscose, are free from harmful substances. It tests for over 100 harmful chemicals, ensuring safety for consumers and reducing environmental impact from chemical residues.
5. OEKO-TEX® ECO PASSPORT: Verifies that chemicals, dyes, and auxiliaries used in textile production, including viscose, are free from harmful substances and comply with environmental standards, ensuring safer production processes.
6. Bluesign® System: Enforces strict chemical management, eliminating hazardous substances like carbon disulfide in viscose production. It promotes eco-friendly dyeing and resource-efficient processes to minimize environmental and worker health risks.
7. Cradle to Cradle Certified: Evaluates viscose across material health, recyclability, renewable energy, water stewardship, and social fairness. It ensures chemicals used are safe and processes are sustainable, supporting closed-loop systems.    
8. GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard): While primarily for organic fibers, GOTS can apply to viscose if sourced from certified organic cellulose. It restricts toxic chemicals and ensures environmentally friendly processing, including wastewater treatment.
These certifications prioritize closed-loop systems (e.g., ECOVERO™, Bluesign®) that recycle chemicals and water, significantly reducing the environmental and health impacts of toxic substances like carbon disulfide and sodium hydroxide. Look for brands using these certifications, such as Lenzing, Stella McCartney, or TWOTHIRDS, to ensure eco-friendly viscose. Always verify brand transparency, as greenwashing can occur without these certifications.
