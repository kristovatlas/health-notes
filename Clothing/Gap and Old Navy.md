Gap and Old Navy, both owned by Gap Inc., offer selections of clothing made from all-natural and organic fabrics, though their focus on organic materials is more limited compared to brands specializing in sustainable fashion. Here’s an overview of their offerings based on available information:

- Organic Cotton:
    
    - Gap: Gap has incorporated organic cotton into some of its clothing lines, particularly in categories like T-shirts, sweatshirts, baby clothing, and loungewear. For example, Gap’s baby and kids’ lines often include organic cotton onesies, pajamas, and basic tees. The Gap website highlights items like organic cotton T-shirts and joggers, emphasizing softness and sustainability for casual wear. However, organic cotton is not the majority of their inventory, and many products still use conventional cotton or synthetic blends.
        
    - Old Navy: Old Navy also offers organic cotton in select items, especially in their baby and kids’ collections. Examples include organic cotton bodysuits, leggings, and sleepwear. Old Navy’s website occasionally features organic cotton graphic tees and loungewear for adults, but these are less prominent than conventional cotton or polyester-based clothing. Their organic offerings are often marketed as budget-friendly and comfortable for everyday wear.
        
- Other Natural Fibers:
    
    - Both brands primarily focus on cotton (organic and conventional) but occasionally use other natural fibers like linen and hemp in limited collections. For instance, Gap’s summer collections may include linen shirts or dresses, and Old Navy has offered linen-blend pants or tops. These are typically blended with synthetic fibers like polyester or elastane to enhance durability or stretch, reducing the “all-natural” purity.
        
    - Wool and silk are rare in both brands’ mainstream offerings, appearing mostly in Gap’s higher-end women’s sweaters or dresses, but these are not typically certified organic or marketed as sustainably sourced.
        
- Availability and Scope:
    
    - Organic Selection: The organic cotton selection at both Gap and Old Navy is relatively small compared to their overall inventory. Organic items are more common in baby and kids’ clothing, where consumer demand for safer, non-toxic materials is higher. Adult organic clothing is often limited to basics like T-shirts, hoodies, or pajamas.
        
    - Labeling and Certifications: Gap and Old Navy sometimes label organic cotton items with certifications like the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), which ensures the cotton is grown without synthetic pesticides and processed without harmful chemicals. However, not all organic-labeled items explicitly mention GOTS, and some may use less rigorous certifications like Oeko-Tex (which focuses on chemical safety but not necessarily organic farming).
        
    - Accessibility: Both brands make their organic and natural-fiber clothing accessible through their websites and physical stores, with Old Navy offering more budget-friendly options. Gap’s organic items tend to be slightly pricier but still affordable compared to premium sustainable brands.
        
- Challenges in Selection:
    
    - Limited Range: Neither brand offers a comprehensive organic or all-natural clothing line across all categories (e.g., outerwear, activewear, or denim). Organic cotton is often confined to specific products, and many items still incorporate synthetic fibers or non-organic cotton.
        
    - Greenwashing Concerns: Some reports note that Gap and Old Navy’s “organic” or “sustainable” claims can be vague, particularly regarding dyes and finishing processes, which may still involve synthetic chemicals even in organic cotton garments. Consumers are advised to check for clear certifications like GOTS to avoid misleading claims.
        

Practices Concerning Toxic Chemicals Like PFAS

Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), often called “forever chemicals,” are used in textiles for water- and stain-resistant properties. Gap Inc. has faced scrutiny for PFAS in its products but has taken steps to address toxic chemical use, including PFAS, in its supply chain. Here’s a detailed look at their practices:

- PFAS Phase-Out Commitment:
    
    - Goal Achieved: Gap Inc. publicly committed to eliminating intentionally added PFAS from its supply chain by the end of 2023, a goal it reportedly met. According to Gap Inc.’s 2023 sustainability report, over 99% of shipped items with water- or stain-repellent qualities were made without PFAS treatments. This applies to both Gap and Old Navy products, particularly in categories like outerwear, activewear, and children’s clothing, where PFAS were historically used.
        
    - Implementation: Gap Inc. worked with suppliers to transition to PFAS-free alternatives for water- and stain-resistant finishes. This involved updating its Restricted Substances List (RSL) and Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL) to ban PFAS and other harmful chemicals in production processes. The company collaborated with organizations like the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) program to ensure compliance.
        
    - Verification: Gap Inc. claims to conduct regular testing and audits to verify PFAS-free status, though specific details on testing frequency or third-party verification are limited in public reports.
        
- Historical PFAS Presence:
    
    - Studies and Findings: Despite Gap Inc.’s efforts, studies from 2022 and earlier detected PFAS in Gap and Old Navy products:
        
        - A 2022 Silent Spring Institute study found PFAS in children’s clothing from Gap (e.g., baby jeggings) and Old Navy (e.g., girls’ shirts), even in items labeled as “green” or “non-toxic.” The study noted fluorine (a PFAS marker) in 54% of tested textiles, with higher levels in water- or stain-resistant items.
            
        - A Mamavation investigation (2022) detected fluorine (indicating PFAS) in Old Navy activewear, specifically workout pants, at 17 parts per million (ppm) in the crotch area, suggesting intentional treatment for sweat-wicking or stain resistance.
            
        - A Toxic-Free Future report (2022) found that 72% of water- or stain-resistant textiles, including Gap and Old Navy products, tested positive for PFAS, highlighting their widespread use before phase-out efforts.
            
    - Context: These findings predate Gap Inc.’s 2023 PFAS-free milestone, suggesting that earlier products (especially pre-2023 inventory) may still contain PFAS. Consumers purchasing older stock or secondhand items should be cautious, particularly for water-resistant or stain-repellent clothing.
        
- Other Toxic Chemicals:
    
    - Chemical Management: Gap Inc. has a broader chemical management program aimed at reducing hazardous substances beyond PFAS. This includes:
        
        - Phthalates, Azo Dyes, and Formaldehyde: Gap Inc. restricts these chemicals through its RSL, which aligns with industry standards like the Apparel and Footwear International RSL Management (AFIRM) group. These chemicals are linked to health issues like hormone disruption and cancer, and Gap Inc. claims to monitor their use in dyes, finishes, and treatments.
            
        - Pesticides in Cotton: While organic cotton avoids synthetic pesticides, Gap Inc.’s conventional cotton (the majority of its inventory) may involve pesticides like glyphosate, which can remain in trace amounts. The company has not publicly detailed plans to transition entirely to organic cotton but promotes sustainable cotton sourcing through initiatives like the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI).
            
    - Transparency: Gap Inc. publishes its RSL and MRSL publicly and reports progress on chemical management in its sustainability reports. However, critics note that transparency about specific dyes or finishing chemicals (beyond PFAS) is limited, and third-party certifications for chemical safety (e.g., Oeko-Tex) are not universally applied across products.
        
- Industry Ratings and Criticism:
    
    - U.S. PIRG Report (2022): Gap Inc. received a B grade for its PFAS phase-out efforts, praised for its time-bound commitment to eliminate PFAS by 2023. This was better than many competitors, though brands like Levi Strauss and Keen Footwear, which fully eliminated PFAS earlier, scored higher.
        
    - Green America (2019): Gap Inc. was rated “above average” for chemical management and transparency compared to other major retailers, but the report noted room for improvement in fully disclosing supplier practices and eliminating all hazardous chemicals.
        
    - Criticism: Environmental groups like the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and Toxic-Free Future have urged Gap Inc. to strengthen third-party certifications and ensure PFAS-free alternatives are equally safe. The presence of PFAS in “green” or “non-toxic” labeled products (pre-2023) raised concerns about greenwashing, prompting calls for more rigorous standards.
        
- Consumer Recommendations:
    
    - To avoid PFAS in Gap and Old Navy clothing, opt for items not marketed as water- or stain-resistant, as these are less likely to have PFAS treatments, even post-2023. Check product descriptions for PFAS-free or PFC-free labels.
        
    - Choose organic cotton or natural fiber clothing (e.g., linen, wool) to minimize exposure to synthetic chemicals. Look for GOTS or Oeko-Tex certifications for added assurance.
        
    - Wash new clothing before wearing to reduce residual chemicals, using unscented, non-toxic detergents. This is especially important for children’s clothing, as kids are more vulnerable to chemical exposure.
        
    - Be cautious with activewear or outerwear purchased before 2023, as these were more likely to contain PFAS. If possible, verify with Gap Inc.’s customer service whether specific items are PFAS-free.
        

Summary

- All-Natural and Organic Selections: Gap and Old Navy offer limited but accessible organic cotton clothing, primarily in baby, kids’, and basic adult categories (e.g., T-shirts, pajamas). Linen and other natural fibers appear in select collections, but synthetic blends are common. Look for GOTS-certified items to ensure organic integrity, as “organic” claims may not always cover dyes or finishes.
    
- PFAS and Toxic Chemical Practices: Gap Inc. has made significant strides, achieving its 2023 goal to eliminate intentionally added PFAS from its supply chain, with over 99% of water- or stain-repellent items now PFAS-free. However, pre-2023 studies found PFAS in Gap and Old Navy products, particularly in activewear and children’s clothing. The company restricts other chemicals like phthalates and azo dyes but faces criticism for limited transparency on dyes and finishing processes. Consumers should prioritize organic, non-treated fabrics and verify certifications to minimize chemical exposure.
