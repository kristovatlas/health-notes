Summary:
* Melatonin is an anti-oxidant produced inside cells
* [This study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3499892/) "Red Light and the Sleep Quality and Endurance Performance of Chinese Female Basketball Players" looked at red light therapy and sleep
* They observed a substantial increase in melatonin production
* Protocol: 30 J/cm^2 achievable with consumer grade devices in 5-15 min
* "The red-light treatment participants received 30 minutes of irradiation from a red-light therapy instrument **every night** for 14 days."
* "The red-light treatment participants lay in the supine position, and continuous illumination was performed using noncoherent red light from a whole-body red-light treatment machine (Shanghai Dayou PDT Technology Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China) with an average wavelength of 658 nm and light dose of 30 J/cm2. The whole body received the phototherapy treatment ([Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3499892/#i1062-6050-47-6-673-f01)). In general studies, investigators have used 14 days[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3499892/#i1062-6050-47-6-673-b20),[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3499892/#i1062-6050-47-6-673-b21) or 7 days[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3499892/#i1062-6050-47-6-673-b22) as 1 session period, so we chose 14 days as a trial time"
