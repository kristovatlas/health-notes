Summary:
* Video from the channel "Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! Mike Lustgarten, PhD"
* In this interview segment with Glen Jeffery, he claims that red light therapy "only" works in the morning, and explains that this coincides with morning surges in day light exposure in the ancestral environment

Observations:
* This seems to run contrary to the findings of others studies such as the one referenced in [[How Red Light Therapy Improves Your Sleep]]
* Glen Jeffery also incorrectly states that blood glucose spikes in the morning independent of food intake
