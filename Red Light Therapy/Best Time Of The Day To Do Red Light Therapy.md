Summary:
* We have a sleep immunity to natural levels of IR light since it comes from fire, warm bodies, etc.
* But, red light therapy has an unnatural intensity and so treatment aimed at the face may be stimulating at night
* Muscle recovery best after workout
* Sleep quality increased by doing red light therapy in the evening
