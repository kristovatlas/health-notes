> On this special episode of the Architect of Resilience Podcast, host [[Chris Duffin]] welcomes back Dr. [[Rahul Desai]], a regenerative musculoskeletal radiologist and expert in innovative therapies for joint and spine health. Originally recorded during a private member community session, this conversation dives deep into the cutting-edge world of red and near-infrared light therapyâ€”otherwise known as photobiomodulation. Dr. Desai shares his extensive experience using platelet-rich plasma (PRP), bone marrow, and fat-derived treatments to help patients heal without surgery, and he unpacks the science and safety of red light therapy for tissue regeneration, pain relief, and overall wellness. The discussion is packed with direct audience questions, revealing practical insights on treatment timing, optimal dosing, systemic versus local effects, and the latest research on using light therapy for everything from injury recovery to anti-aging and sleep.

Sleep protocol:
* 1-2 hours before bed
* okay to expose eyes with eyelids closed
* increases Rahul's REM sleep measurably

Eye exposure:
* Study showed red light effect in rats with vision, not effective for blind rats

Other:
* Chris Duffin pairs red light exposure with a PNF mat and noticed a great effect on energy and sleep

Maximum Effect Dose:
* About 20 minutes per region per day-- fine to move light to other areas and treat those additionally without risk. Main risk is thermal effect on skin due to overexposure
