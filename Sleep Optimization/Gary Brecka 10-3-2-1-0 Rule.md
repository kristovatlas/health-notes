[[Gary Brecka]]'s 10-3-2-1-0 sleep rule is a structured pre-bedtime routine designed to optimize sleep quality by aligning with the body's natural rhythms and minimizing disruptions. Here’s a summary:

- **10 hours before bed: Stop consuming caffeine** to allow it to clear from your system, as it can disrupt melatonin production and sleep onset.
- **3 hours before bed: Avoid food** and alcohol to prevent digestion or blood sugar spikes from interfering with deep sleep. This includes no large meals or heavy snacks.
- **2 hours before bed: Stop working** (e.g., emails, intense mental tasks) to reduce stress and allow the mind to unwind, signaling the body to prepare for rest.
    
- **1 hour before bed: Limit blue light exposure from screens** (phones, TVs, computers). Use blue light-blocking glasses or filters, and engage in **calming activities like reading or [[Gary Brecka Breathing Recommendations#4-7-8 Breathing (Sleep Preparation)]]** to relax.  
- 0: Aim for zero wake-ups during the night by creating an optimal sleep environment—cool (**65-68°F**), dark, quiet, and free of distractions.
