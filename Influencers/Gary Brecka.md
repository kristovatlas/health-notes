* With a background in mortality modeling for life insurance, Brecka uses blood and genetic testing to identify deficiencies and tailor health plans. 
* He promotes methods like:
	* the [[30-30-30 Method]], 
	* low-carb/high-fat diets, 
	* supplements, and 
	* practices such as cold exposure and breathwork. 
* Popular on social media and podcasts, he advises high-profile clients but faces criticism for some unverified claims, like precise life expectancy predictions.

# Top health tips

Here are his top health tips based on available information:

1. Follow the [[30-30-30 Method]]: Consume 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking, followed by 30 minutes of low-intensity, steady-state cardio (heart rate below 135 bpm). This stabilizes blood sugar, reduces cravings, and promotes fat burning.
2. Adopt a Low-Carb, High-Fat Diet: Emphasize whole, unprocessed foods, healthy fats (70-75% of calories), moderate protein (20-25%), and **minimal carbs (5-10%)**. Avoid refined sugars, white rice, processed seed oils (e.g., canola, soybean), and non-organic/GMO vegetables. Opt for flash-frozen organic veggies for nutrient retention.    
3. Prioritize Nutrient-Dense Foods: Focus on **grass-fed meats**, **wild-caught fish**, and nutrient-rich foods like **asparagus**, **Brussels sprouts**, **broccoli**, and **arugula**. **Limit carbs before 2 PM** to avoid energy dips.    
4. Hydrate with Quality Water: Drink **hydrogen water** or mineralized water (e.g., with Celtic or Baja Gold sea salt) to reduce inflammation, support gut health, and improve nutrient absorption. Avoid tap water due to contaminants.    
5. Incorporate Key Supplements: Take personalized supplements based on blood and genetic tests. Brecka recommends:    
    - **Magnesium** (glycinate or l-threonate, not oxide) for relaxation and heart health.
    - **Zinc** for immune support and hormone production.
    - **Vitamin B12** (methylcobalamin) for energy and nerve function.
    - **Vitamin D3** for immunity and bone health.        
    - **Omega-3s** (e.g., EPA fish oil) for inflammation and brain health.        
6. Practice Biohacking Techniques:
    - **Cold Exposure**: Use cold plunges for recovery and mental clarity.
    - **Breathwork**: Perform three rounds of 30 breaths daily (e.g., Wim Hof method) to reduce stress and enhance oxygen intake.
    - **Grounding**: Walk barefoot on natural surfaces to connect with the earth’s magnetic field.
    - **Morning Sunlight: Get 45 minutes of early sunlight** to regulate circadian rhythms.
7. Optimize Sleep: Maintain a consistent sleep schedule (7-9 hours) to support recovery and hormonal balance.
8. Exercise Regularly: **Lift weights 3-5 times weekly**, aim for **10,000 steps daily**, and include **low-intensity cardio to burn fat without lactic acid buildup**.    
9. Personalize Health with Testing: Use blood and genetic tests to identify deficiencies and tailor diet, supplements, and lifestyle changes.    
10. Simplify and Stay Consistent: Focus on basics—whole foods, movement, hydration, and mental health—avoiding overcomplication. Embrace discomfort (e.g., fasting, cold exposure) to build resilience.

Note: Some claims, like precise life expectancy predictions, lack robust scientific backing, and Brecka’s high-fat diet may not suit everyone, potentially increasing heart disease risk for some. Always consult a healthcare professional before making significant changes.
